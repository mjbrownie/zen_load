Zen_load - a Very simple load monitor to use with dzen

will display load/memory/disk and be a clickable shortcut to remote servers.

Also it has pretty color coding for any numbers you need to worry about.

I'm using in an xmonad setup to monitor about 5 servers.

It looks like this

or with EXTRA_EXTRA_ZEN

Clicking on the numbers will open a shell

prerequisites:
    dzen2: (The very latest to support the ^co command tag).
    you may need to compile from source.

    urxvt: hardcoded ... sorry lazy for now...fork :)

    Server logins must already be authenticated by an ssh-agent


It will periodically check load/mem/disk via a cron script

1. clone and make a fifo

    eg. mkfifo ~/.zen_load/fifo

2. Create a ~/.zen_load/servers.txt file looks like this

www:username@webserver.com
mail:username@mailserver.com
dns:username@dnsserver.com

2. in your crontab 
    * * * * * cd ~/ && ~/.zen_load/monitor.py > ~/.zen_load/fifo

3. Load somewhere in the background. (Eg. check out my dotfiles xmonad.hs)
    "tail -f ~/.zen_load/fifo | dzen2 -ta r "

    An example xmonad.hs using can be found here
